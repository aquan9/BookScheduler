# BookScheduler
A program that writes a schedule for books that you want to read. 

Simply answer a few questions and the program will write a day to day schedule based on how much
time you have for each book that you mention. 

run with python3

e.g.

python3 BookScheduler.py

Please note, this was just a simple thing to make sure I had github running properly, and to practice a few commands.
